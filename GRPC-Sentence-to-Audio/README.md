# gRPC in Text-to-Audio Conversion Service

# Introduction to gRPC

gRPC is a modern, high-performance framework that enables different systems to communicate with each other. It stands for gRPC Remote Procedure Call, reflecting its ability to perform nearly as if the client and server were in the same system. gRPC uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, load balancing, and more. It supports multiple languages, making it an ideal choice for building scalable microservices and distributed systems.

# Project Overview

In this project, we leverage gRPC to build a text-to-audio conversion service. The service transforms written text into spoken words, facilitating accessibility features or content consumption. The system architecture involves a client-server model where:

Client: Sends a sentence as text to the server.

Server: Converts the text into speech using Google's Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library and returns a URL to access the generated audio file.
